<h3>Raider</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Updated WotLK loot tables. Reserving a Heroic Mode item will also count as reserving the matching Normal Mode item (doesn't cost extra reserves).</li>
  <li>Can now search all reserves by player name.</li>
  <li>Favorited items now glow when they're being rolled. Removed the option to glow for all items.</li>
  <li>Reserves and Favorites tabs now sort items by the order of the bosses that drop them, instead of alphabetic order.</li>
  <li>Automatically rolling on reserved items works with Group Loot.</li>
  <li>Rolling Need on an item with Group Loot prompts for confirmation if the item is reserved, but not by you.</li>
  <li>Minimap button can also be hidden with middle mouse click. Visibility can be toggled in Reserves window settings.</li>
  <li>Add more chat aliases: !remove (!cancelreserve) and !reserver (!reserves).</li>
  <li>Reserves window is a little smarter about when to open automatically.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Host</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added tiered rolls, so you can roll Main Spec (1-100) and Off Spec (1-99) at the same time. Customizable.</li>
  <li>Exporting rolls now indicates if an item was raid rolled or disenchanted.</li>
  <li>Add info about !myreserves command in the whisper reply when !reserves command item limit is reached.</li>
  <li>Adding a disenchanter now enables that disenchanter by default.</li>
  <li>Missing VoA bosses are no longer visible. Currently that means only Toravon is hidden.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed auto roll message showing up when not actually rolling.</li>
  <li>Unfavoriting an item in the Favorites tab now causes that item to disappear immediately.</li>
  <li>Fixed shy dropdown menus. They once again stay open when certain options are clicked.</li>
  <li>Fixed lua error when importing an item that doesn't exist.</li>
  <li>Fixed visual bug when host is reserving on behalf of other players and reopens the Reserves window.</li>
  <li>Addon communications reduced slightly.</li>
</ul>
