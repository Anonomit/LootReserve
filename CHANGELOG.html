<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Distribute button should properly be unclickable while it's certain that the recipient is out of follow range in an instance.</li>
  <li>Linked the quest for <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=235049">[Nightmare Engulfed Object]</a>. It should now appear as unusable if you've already handed in the quest.</li>
</ul>
