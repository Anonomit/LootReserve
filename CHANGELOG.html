<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Host</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Now puts a message in chat when a reserved item is being rolled through Group Loot.</li>
<li>Recent Loot dropdown now shows a gold icon by BoE items.</li>
<li>Distribution buttons no longer prompt you to trade items while you're dead. Now they advise you to be alive first.</li>
<li>LootReserve may whisper players who appear to be wanting to pass on a roll in chat, but did not explicitly say the command 'pass' or '-1'.</li>
<li>Chat message commands are now more loosely recognized. It's no longer necessary to use a leading exclamation mark over whispers.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Client</strong></p>

<li>Sapphiron quest rewards can now be seen in the Naxxramas loot tables.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated to patch 3.4.1.</li>
<li>Fixed search bars in host window only working for items. They once again will find players as well.</li>
<li>The Insert button in the trade window now ignores untradeable items, just like the other distribution buttons.</li>

<li>Fixed a UI issue for the host after reserving for another player and then closing and opening the reserves window.</li>
<li>Fixed a lua error when opening the reserves window after starting a session with no raids selected.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with data not upgrading correctly in some ancient settings files.</li>
</ul>
