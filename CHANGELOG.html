<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Importing reserves no longer requires an item column to be present. This allows importing to be used just to set player-specific settings, like reserve limit and +1 score.</li>
  <li>Hosts who intend to make LootReserve a required addon in their raid now have an option to disable to !reserve chat command. This prevents players from managing their reserves through chat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Host window now always shows addon users, making it easier to check your own addon version when ungrouped.</li>
  <li>Window sizes are now more aggressively restricted, and should scale up automatically if the minimum size has been increased beyond what a player has set.</li>
  <li>Changed Mogu'shan Vaults nickname: Vaults -> MSV.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Updated some fonts since Blizzard is removing them.</li>
